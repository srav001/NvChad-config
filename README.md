Custom config for NvChad

This supports Typescript out of the box along with Vue. Small changes from default config for personal preference. 

To use this config, clone the repository into to the lua folder of NvChad as `custom`.  

```sh
git clone git@github.com:srav001/NvChad-config.git custom
```
